title: "Why?"
---
**We were six in a big house**. It looks like a movie title, but thing is, being almost **40 years old** and after **7 movings** in 4 cities and 3 Brazilian states, we felt now the need of a **smaller house** and a **huge yard**. We want to live our lives intentionally. So we decided to hit the road and take our children out to know the world!
