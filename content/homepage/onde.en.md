title: "Where?"
---
**Who knows** really?

The things is, while planning we established several itinerary ideias, all completely different between each other. ~~Pan American Highway (from Ushuaia to Alaska)~~, ~~United States and Canada~~, ~~Europe (going in and out from countries belonging the Schengen Area)~~, ~~Brazil only~~.
  
For now, we have established our itinerary **Ushuaia &rarr; Cartagena**, departing from **Canela**, a city in the south of Brazil. In other words, we will pass through Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, to finally return and explore the beautiful landscapes of Brazil.

Since we follow the **intentional life** philosophy, we will rethink our itinerary all the time, keeping our journey while we are happy doing it!
